# c3po / Building Boulder

BuildingBoulder is an app to help our community to engage in conversation around construction projects and smart growth. The BuildingBoulder app will allow anyone to find construction projects on a map, follow these projects throughout the development lifecycle based on their location and preferences, and join discussions within the app.
